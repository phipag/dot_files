# Phipag's Dotfiles
This repository contains the config files (aka dotfiles) for my personal shell experience with Oh My Zsh and iTerm2 on MacOS.

# Getting started
Clone this repository with all its submodules to your local machine.
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/phipag/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
Activate each feature by following the instructions in the corresponding subfolder. This is typically as easy as symlinking configuration files to your home folder.
