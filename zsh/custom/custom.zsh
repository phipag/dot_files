# You can put files here to add functionality separated per file, which
# will be ignored by git.
# Files on the custom/ directory will be automatically loaded by the init
# script, in alphabetical order.

# For example: add yourself some shortcuts to projects you often work on.
#
# brainstormr=~/Projects/development/planetargon/brainstormr
# cd $brainstormr

# Jenv to manage multiple java versions (Comment out if you do not use it)
eval "$(jenv init -)"

# Handy utility function to measure Shell startup performance
